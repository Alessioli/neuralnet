# neuralnet
Training of Neural Networks

The **neuralnet** package is now on GitHub! New maintainer will be [@mnwright](https://github.com/mnwright).

Please note that **neuralnet** will not turn into a super fast deep learning framework. We will continue to focus on ease of use and flexibility.

Please post any issue you have with the package here on GitHub. Code contributions are also very welcome!
